    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Information gain as we discussed earlier is calculated using a statistical measure called the __Entropy__. Entropy is a widely used concept used in fields of Physics, mathematics, computer science (information theory) etc. You may come across the idea of entropy in thermodynamics, societal dynamics and a number of other domains. In electronics and computer sciences, the idea of entropy is usually derived from __Shannon's__ description of entropy to measure the information gain against some cost incurred in the process. In this lesson, we shall look at how this works with the simple example we introduced in previous lesson. \n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Understand and Explain Shannon's Entropy and Information Gain measures. \n",
    "- Calculate Entropy and Information gain by hand for a simple dataset. \n",
    "- Identify the process for selecting best attribute for a split. \n"

    "## Shannon's Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Entropy is a measure of Disorder or Uncertainty.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure is Named after *Claude Shannon*, who is known as the \"father of information theory\". Information theory provides measures of the uncertainty associated with a random variables. These measures help calculate the average information content one is missing when one does not know the value of the random variable. This uncertainty is measures in bits bits, i.e.  the amount of information (in bits) contained per average instance of an instance in a stream of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, information can be thought of as being stored in or transmitted as variables that can take on different values. A variable can be thought of as a unit of storage that can take on, at different times, one of several different specified values, following some process for taking on those values. Informally, we get information from a variable by looking at its value, just as we get information from an email by reading its contents. In the case of the variable, the information is about the process behind the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The entropy of a variable is the \"amount of information\" contained in the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This amount is determined not just by the number of different values the variable can take on, just as the information in an email is quantified not just by the number of words in the email or the different possible words in the language of the email. Informally, the amount of information in an email is proportional to the amount of “surprise” its reading causes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an email is simply a repeat of an earlier email, then it is not informative at all. On the other hand, if say the email reveals the outcome of an election, then it is highly informative. Similarly, the information in a variable is tied to the amount of surprise that value of the variable causes when revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Shannon’s entropy quantifies the amount of information in a variable, thus providing the foundation for a theory around the notion of information.\n",

    "\n",
    "In terms of data, we can informally describe entropy as:\n",
    "> Entropy is an indicator of how messy your data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high entropy always reflects \"messed-up\" data with low/no information content. The uncertainty about content of the data, before viewing the data remains same (or almost same) as that before the data was available. \n"

So we maximize the **Purity** of the classes __as much as possible__ while making the splits, aiming to have a __clarity__ in the leaf nodes. Remember, it may not be possible to remove the uncertainty totally i.e. to fully clean up the data. Have a look at the image below:\n",

    "We can see that the split has not __FULLY__ classified the data above, but the resulting data is __tidier__ than it was before the split. Using a series of such splits using different feature variables, we try to clean up the data as much as possible in the leaf nodes. At each step, we want to decrease the entropy, so __entropy is computed before after the split__. If it decreases, the split is retained and we can proceed to the next step, otherwise, we must try to split with another feature or stop this branch (or quit, calling it best solution).\n",

    "Above equation tells us that according to entropy law, a dataset is considered tidy if it only contains one class (i.e. no uncertainty or confusion). If there is a mix of classes in the target variable , the entropy (or uncertainty about data) goes high. Looking at the entropy function below, when $p=0$ , i.e. no observations for class 1, OR , if all data belongs to class 1 so that $p=1$, the entropy will become zero. It will be MAXIMUM when there is an equal mix of classes 1 and 2 observations i.e. $p=0.5$ tells us that we are equally uncertain about both classes. Think about a fair coin. Before the coin toss, your uncertainty is is at max because any side can come up. The entropy , hence, is maximum.  \n",

    "When we start with a messy set with entropy 1 (p=q). In the worst case, it could be split into 2 messy sets where half of the items are labeled 1 and the other half have Label 2 in each set. Hence the entropy of each of the two resulting sets is 1. In this scenario, the uncertainty has not changed and we would have the same entropy before and after the split. We can not just sum the entropies of the two sets. A solution, often used in mathematics, is to compute the mean entropy of the two sets. \n",
